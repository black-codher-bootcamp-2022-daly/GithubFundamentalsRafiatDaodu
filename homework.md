# :page_with_curl: **A Very Short Section On What I Have Learned and What I Understand** :page_with_curl:
### ***Don't worry, this really won't be a long read***
1. The difference between **Git**  *(a source control system that lets you track and manage changes to source code)* and **GitHub** *(a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories nd colloborate with others)*.
2. What are repositories *(a project folder where work happenes)* and how to create them.
3. How to clone repositories so that the duplicate *(including all data at that point in time - all versions of every file and folder for the project)* is synced to your local machine.
4. Using markdown - the only thing I thnk I understand and can comfortably execute.

# :triangular_flag_on_post: **What I'm Still Confused About** :triangular_flag_on_post:
### ***AKA it's astonishing how I can't seem to grasp simple conceptsand excute***
In one word: **Everything**!!! I seem to understand (barely) the theoretical concepts, but alas when it comes to putting them into proactice, I really struggle to excute them well. For example:
- How to easily find and open cloned repositories on my computer and in VS Code. :confused:	
- The differences between cloning, forking and branches; how and when to use them. :grimacing:
- Committing and pushing finished work successully, first time. It seems to take me several attempts. :confused:
- PULL REQUESTS!!!! :scream:

# :rainbow: Final Thoughts :rainbow:
Git and GitHub have been a struggle for me, especially as a person who usually grasps new ideas and skills quickly and usually exceptionally well. I've felt demoralised and honestly I have cried many times  during the first month of learning :laughing: :laughing: :laughing:. But I have fully accepted that during this bootcamp this will not  be the first or last time. In fact I guarantee that these feelings of lack of understanding and bewilderment will happen a lot and so I take heart in the quote by *Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*:
> ***Everything is hard before it is easy***.
